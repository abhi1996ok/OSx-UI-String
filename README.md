# OSx-UI-String
This the second version of OSx -UI for the file sharing platform,which is used the string for foldering.
This project is similar as the OSx UI API but there the API's not in action the foldering is made on the basis of the
string path of the folder... for Example..

    https://azurestorage/temp1/subtemp/partition/yourData/image.jpg.
    
Here, the index is used for the initial folder during the folder compositon.
the index can be decided there "/" seperation for example-
   https as 0.
   azurestorage as 1 etc.
   
   This a pure js based and the folders are created there dynamically.
   and there the level of foldering is not fixed, so N no of level can be drawn.
